      value="A PRIVACT routine use is a particular kind of disclosure of a record outside of the federal agency maintaining the system of records. A routine use is an exception to the PRIVACT prohibition on the disclosure of a record in a system of records without the prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. To qualify as a routine use, the disclosure must be for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which the information was originally collected. The PRIVACT requires agencies to describe each routine use of the records maintained in the system of records, including the categories of users of the records and the purpose of the use. Agencies may only establish routine uses by explicitly publishing them in the relevant system of records notice."/>
