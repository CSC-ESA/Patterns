    name="CAPEC-113: Interface Manipulation"
    id="id-29288076c5ee4266bcf4df4ebcecfdd3"
    documentation="An adversary manipulates the use or processing of an interface (e.g. Application Programming Interface (API) or System-on-Chip (SoC)) resulting in an adverse impact upon the security of the system implementing the interface. This can allow the adversary to bypass access control and/or execute functionality not intended by the interface implementation, possibly compromising the system which integrates the interface. Interface manipulation can take on a number of forms including forcing the unexpected use of an interface or the use of an interface in an unintended way.">

As a result, dangerous functionality can be exposed within the production environment, which an adversary can leverage to execute additional attacks.::SoC components contain insufficient identifiers, which allows an adversary to reset the device at will or read sensitive data from the device.::"/>
