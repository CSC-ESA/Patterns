    name="CAPEC-175: Code Inclusion"
    id="id-ecf16ac614644c78af101a27ae3fc240"
    documentation="An adversary exploits a weakness on the target to force arbitrary code to be retrieved locally or from a remote location and executed. This differs from code injection in that code injection involves the direct inclusion of code while code inclusion involves the addition or replacement of a reference to a code file, which is subsequently loaded by the target and used as part of the code of some application.">
