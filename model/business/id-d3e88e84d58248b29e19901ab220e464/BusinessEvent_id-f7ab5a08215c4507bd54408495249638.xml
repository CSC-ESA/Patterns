      value="TYPE:Other:NOTE:Large quantities of data is often moved from the target system to some other adversary controlled system. Data found on a target system might require extensive resources to be fully analyzed. Using these resources on the target system might enable a defender to detect the adversary. Additionally, proper analysis tools required might not be available on the target system.::::TYPE:Other:NOTE:This attack differs from Data Interception and other data collection attacks in that the attacker actively queries the target rather than simply watching for the target to reveal information.::"/>
